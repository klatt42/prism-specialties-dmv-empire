## PRIORITY FIXES NEEDED

1. **CRITICAL: STANDARDIZE NAVIGATION** - 5 different patterns is unacceptable
2. **REMOVE DUPLICATE DC PAGE** - washington-dc.html is broken and redundant
3. **FIX PHONE NUMBER ERRORS** - Wrong DC number on DC page
4. **UNIFY NAVIGATION PATTERN** - Choose single navigation template for all
5. **INTEGRATE CHECKLIST SYSTEM** - Ensure consistent navigation includes Checklists
