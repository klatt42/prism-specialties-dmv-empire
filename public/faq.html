                What are the benefits of art restoration?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                The benefits of art restoration include preserving the artwork's value, enhancing its aesthetic appeal, and extending its lifespan. Restoration can bring faded colors back to life and repair physical damages, making the piece look as intended by the artist. Additionally, it preserves cultural heritage, allowing future generations to appreciate the artwork's original beauty and historical context.

                Can I do art restoration myself?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                While it might be tempting to try art restoration yourself, it is generally not recommended. The process requires specialized skills and knowledge of materials and techniques that professionals possess. DIY attempts can inadvertently damage the artwork further. For best results, consult an expert, like those at Prism Specialties of DC, MD, and VA Metro, who have the expertise to handle delicate restorations.
