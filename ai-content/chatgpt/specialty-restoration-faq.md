## Frequently Asked Questions About Art, Electronics, Textiles & Document Restoration

### Insurance & Claims

**1. Does insurance cover specialty restoration services?**
Yes, most homeowner's and business insurance policies cover specialty restoration when damage is from covered perils (fire, water, storm). However, standard policies often have sublimits for art, electronics, and valuable items. We help document losses and work directly with adjusters to maximize your coverage. Many clients are surprised to learn they have more coverage than they initially thought.

**2. How do I file an insurance claim for damaged collectibles or art?**
Contact your insurance company immediately to report the loss, then call us for emergency stabilization. Do not attempt to clean or move items yourself. We provide detailed documentation, professional photographs, and restoration estimates that insurance companies require. Our IICRC certification and relationship with adjusters helps expedite claims.

**3. What if my insurance company says my items are a "total loss"?**
Insurance adjusters often lack expertise in specialty restoration and may declare items total losses prematurely. We provide professional assessments and work with your adjuster to demonstrate restoration feasibility. In many cases, items deemed "total losses" can be successfully restored for less than replacement cost.

**4. Can you work directly with my insurance company?**
Yes, we work directly with insurance adjusters, provide detailed estimates, and handle the paperwork. We're familiar with insurance requirements and can help navigate the claims process. This saves you time and often results in better coverage outcomes.

### Timeline & Process

**5. How quickly can you respond to an emergency?**
We offer 24/7 emergency response throughout the DMV area. Our goal is to stabilize damaged items within 24 hours to prevent further deterioration. Quick response is critical - every hour of delay can mean the difference between restoration and total loss.

**6. How long does specialty restoration take?**
Timeline varies by damage type and item complexity:
- Electronics restoration: 3-14 days
- Document drying/restoration: 1-4 weeks
- Textile restoration: 2-8 weeks
- Art restoration: 4-16 weeks
Complex or severely damaged items may require longer. We provide detailed timelines after initial assessment.

**7. Can I see my items during the restoration process?**
Absolutely. We encourage client involvement and provide regular progress updates with photos. You can visit our facility by appointment to see your items and discuss the restoration process with our technicians.

**8. What happens if an item cannot be restored?**
We assess every item before beginning work and provide honest evaluations. If restoration isn't possible or cost-effective, we'll document the condition for insurance purposes and discuss alternatives. Our goal is always to save what matters most to you.

### Costs & Pricing

**9. How much does specialty restoration cost?**
Costs vary based on damage extent, item type, and restoration complexity. We provide free assessments and detailed estimates before beginning work. Many clients find restoration costs significantly less than replacement value, especially for irreplaceable family heirlooms.

**10. Do you offer payment plans or financing?**
Yes, we work with clients on payment arrangements and accept insurance direct payments. For large projects, we can arrange financing options. We never want cost to prevent saving your irreplaceable items.

**11. Is restoration cheaper than replacement?**
Often yes, especially for unique or antique items. Even when replacement cost is lower, many items simply cannot be replaced - family photos, heirloom textiles, and personal artwork have value beyond money. We help you make informed decisions about restoration vs. replacement.

### Certifications & Expertise

**12. What certifications do your technicians have?**
Our team holds IICRC (Institute of Inspection, Cleaning and Restoration Certification), EPA RRP (Renovation, Repair, and Painting) certifications, and maintains OSHA compliance. We also have specialized training in museum-quality restoration techniques for different material types.

**13. Do you have experience with high-value items?**
Yes, we regularly work with fine art, antiques, designer clothing, rare documents, and expensive electronics. Our museum-quality techniques and secure facilities are designed for high-value specialty items. We carry appropriate insurance and bonding for valuable items.

**14. Are you licensed and insured?**
Yes, we maintain full licensing, bonding, and insurance coverage including professional liability insurance. This protects both your items and our work throughout the restoration process.

### Damage Types & Specialties

**15. What types of water damage can you restore?**
We handle clean water, gray water, and black water damage. Different water types require different restoration approaches. We also address secondary issues like mold growth that can occur after water damage.

**16. Can you restore fire and smoke damaged items?**
Yes, we specialize in fire and smoke damage restoration. Smoke damage is often more extensive than fire damage and requires specialized cleaning techniques. We can remove smoke odors and soot from electronics, textiles, art, and documents.

**17. Do you handle mold damage restoration?**
Yes, we're certified in mold remediation and can safely restore items affected by mold growth. Mold damage requires immediate attention and specialized techniques to prevent health risks and further deterioration.

**18. What about storm damage and flooding?**
We respond to all storm-related damage including flooding, wind damage, and hail damage. Storm damage often combines multiple damage types (water, debris, mold) requiring comprehensive restoration approaches.
