### Specialty Cleaning with Ultrasonic and Ozone Treatment

**Advanced Cleaning Technology for Unique Restoration Challenges**

When traditional cleaning methods aren't enough, our advanced specialty cleaning technologies provide solutions that seem impossible. Our ultrasonic and ozone treatment capabilities allow us to restore items that others would consider hopeless.

**Advanced Cleaning Technologies:**

**Ultrasonic Cleaning:**
High-frequency sound waves create millions of microscopic bubbles that implode, creating powerful cleaning action that reaches into every crevice and surface irregularity. This technology allows us to clean delicate items without physical scrubbing or harsh chemicals.

**Ozone Treatment:**
Ozone (O₃) is a powerful oxidizing agent that breaks down odor molecules, kills bacteria and mold, and neutralizes chemical contaminants. This environmentally friendly treatment leaves no residue and is safe for most materials.

**What We Clean:**
- Electronics with smoke and soot contamination
- Artwork with surface contamination
- Collectibles with embedded odors
- Textiles with persistent stains
- Documents with mold contamination
- Musical instruments
- Medical and scientific equipment
- Jewelry and precious metals

**Specialty Cleaning Applications:**

**Smoke and Soot Removal:**
- HEPA filtration during cleaning
- Specialized cleaning solutions for different soot types
- Ultrasonic cleaning for intricate surfaces
- Ozone treatment for odor elimination
- Protective coatings to prevent re-contamination

**Mold and Mildew Treatment:**
- HEPA-filtered work environment
- Anti-microbial cleaning solutions
- UV sterilization when appropriate
- Ozone treatment for spore elimination
- Moisture control during processing

**Chemical Contamination:**
- pH neutralization treatments
- Solvent-based contamination removal
- Ion exchange cleaning processes
- Controlled atmospheric processing
- Residue-free final cleaning

**Our Cleaning Process:**
1. **Contamination Analysis**: Identification of contaminants and appropriate treatment
2. **Environmental Control**: HEPA filtration and controlled atmosphere
3. **Pre-Treatment**: Initial contamination reduction and stabilization
4. **Ultrasonic Processing**: High-frequency cleaning in controlled solutions
5. **Ozone Treatment**: Oxidation of remaining contaminants and odors
6. **Final Rinse**: Complete removal of cleaning agents and residues
7. **Quality Verification**: Testing to ensure complete contamination removal
8. **Protective Treatment**: Application of protective coatings when appropriate

**Safety and Environmental Considerations:**
All our specialty cleaning processes are conducted in controlled environments with appropriate safety equipment. Our technicians are trained in chemical safety and environmental protection. Ozone treatment is conducted in sealed chambers with proper ventilation and safety monitoring.

**Items We Cannot Clean:**
While our technologies are advanced, some items cannot be safely cleaned:
- Items with unstable dyes or finishes
- Materials that react poorly to ultrasonic vibration
- Items sensitive to ozone exposure
- Objects with internal electronics that cannot be sealed

We provide honest assessments and alternative solutions when our specialty cleaning technologies are not appropriate for specific items.
