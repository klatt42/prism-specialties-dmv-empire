## ðŸ¤– Advanced Automation Logic

### Engagement Scoring Algorithm
```javascript
function calculateEngagementScore(user) {
    let score = 0;

    // Time-based scoring
    if (user.pdfViewTime >= 300000) score += 50; // 5+ minutes
    else if (user.pdfViewTime >= 60000) score += 30; // 1-5 minutes
    else if (user.pdfViewTime >= 30000) score += 10; // 30s-1 minute

    // Action-based scoring
    if (user.downloadedPDF) score += 25;
    if (user.clickedEmergencyCall) score += 40;
    if (user.optedIntoSMS) score += 20;
    if (user.sharedContent) score += 15;
    if (user.returnVisitor) score += 30;

    // Device-based modifiers
    if (user.device === 'mobile' && user.quickActions) score += 10;
    if (user.device === 'desktop' && user.detailedView) score += 10;

    // Timing modifiers
    if (user.accessedDuringBusinessHours) score += 5;
    if (user.immediateFormSubmission) score += 15;

    return score;
}

function assignNurtureSequence(score, checklistType, device) {
    if (score >= 80) return 'high_engagement_priority';
    if (score >= 40) return 'medium_engagement_education';
    if (score >= 15) return 'low_engagement_reactivation';
    return 'minimal_engagement_awareness';
}
```

### Dynamic Content Personalization
```javascript
function personalizeContent(user, emailTemplate) {
    let content = emailTemplate;

    // Device-specific customization
    if (user.device === 'mobile') {
        content = addMobileOptimization(content);
        content = addSMSPrompts(content);
    }

    // Engagement-based customization
    if (user.engagementLevel === 'high') {
        content = addUrgencyIndicators(content);
        content = addDirectCallPrompts(content);
    }

    // Geographic customization
    if (user.zipCode && isDMVRegion(user.zipCode)) {
        content = addLocalizedContent(content, user.zipCode);
    }

    // Checklist-specific content
    content = addChecklistSpecificTips(content, user.checklistType);

    return content;
}
```
